  Multi-Level Annotation Ontology (MLAO): Description

<span class="markdown">
  Following the Web Annotation Ontology, the annotation itself is an instance of
  the class oa:Annotation with the following properties and object classes: *
  The annotation is connected through the oa:hasTarget property to a target
  (i.e. the annotatum), represented by an instance of the oa:SpecificResource
  class, which identifies part of another resource (referenced with
  oa:hasSource), e.g. a particular representation of a resource, a resource with
  styling hints for renders, or any combination of these. In the case of digital
  images or facsimile using IIIF, the source is the Canvas which conveys the
  image, while the property oa:hasSelector is connected to a oa:FragmentSelector
  instance which describes the set of coordinates of the segment or region of
  interest within the source resource. * The annotation is connected through the
  oa:hasBody property to a body represented as an instance of the oa:TextualBody
  class. The body (i.e., the annotans) contains the actual content of the
  annotation, e.g. unstructured textual data such as a comment, a tag, a
  transcription etc. * An instance of the oa:Motivation class is linked with the
  annotation through the oa:hasMotivation object property, and used to record
  intents of the annotator for the creation of the Annotation (e.g. commenting,
  tagging, transcribing etc). An anchor is then represented as an instance of
  the mlao:Anchor class and connected with an instance of the oa:Annotation
  class by employing the mlao:hasAnchor property. The mlao:Anchor class
  describes the intentional object or referent of the annotation, which can be
  different from the target itself. The instance of the Anchor is then linked
  through the mlao:hasConceptualLevel object property to an instance of type
  frbroo:F1_Work, frbroo:F2_Expression, frbroo:F4_Manifestation or
  frbroo:F5_Item, describing the FRBR conceptual level. Finally, the Anchor is
  linked through the mlao:isAnchoredTo object property to an instance of the
  work it refers to which represents its real-world counterpart. By associating
  the annotation with a referent in the “real world” (an URI that describes an
  entity) and with an area in a piece of media that captured it, e.g. the
  target, we reduce the semantic deficit that separates the annotation from the
  thing being annotated and improve the computer's ability to use the link in a
  more general manner. For example, in the annotation modelled in Figure 2 the
  creator annotates a specific portion of the image to convey content, namely
  the transcription, which does not refer to the image itself but to another
  entity. In fact, the transcription does not concern the digital image itself
  but rather another kind of entity connected to the manuscript Vat. gr. 984
  manuscript, which is an Expression according to the FRBR levels. Consequently,
  the annotation is linked to an anchor by the property mlao:hasAnchor. This
  allows the annotator to specify the conceptual level to which they are
  referring. Finally, the instance of mlao:Anchor class has two properties,
  mlao:hasConceptualLevel and mlao:isAnchoredTo, which are employed to specify
  the frbroo:F2_Expression and the real-world entity, respectively. The latter
  is represented by the URI that denotes the manuscript Vat. gr. 984, which is
  linked to the digital image. The following figure shows classes (rectangles),
  object properties (solid lines beginning with a solid circle and ending with a
  solid arrow), and assertions among classes (solid lines ending with a solid
  arrow).
