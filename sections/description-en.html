  Following the Web Annotation Ontology, the annotation itself is an instance of
  the class oa:Annotation with the following properties and object classes:
</span>

<ul class="description">
  <li>
    The annotation is connected through the oa:hasTarget property to a target
    (i.e. the annotatum), represented by an instance of the <code>oa:SpecificResource</code>
    class, which identifies part of another resource (referenced with
    <code>oa:hasSource</code>), e.g. a particular representation of a resource, a resource
    with styling hints for renders, or any combination of these. In the case of
    digital images or facsimile using IIIF, the source is the Canvas which
    conveys the image, while the property <code>oa:hasSelector</code> is connected to a
    <code>oa:FragmentSelector</code> instance which describes the set of coordinates of the
    segment or region of interest within the source resource.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    The annotation is connected through the <code>oa:hasBody</code> property to a body
    represented as an instance of the <code>oa:TextualBody</code> class. The body (i.e., the
    annotans) contains the actual content of the annotation, e.g. unstructured
    textual data such as a comment, a tag, a transcription etc.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    An instance of the <code>oa:Motivation</code> class is linked with the annotation through
    the <code>oa:hasMotivation</code> object property, and used to record intents of the
    annotator for the creation of the Annotation (e.g. commenting, tagging,
    transcribing etc).
  </li>
</ul>

<span class="markdown">
    An anchor is then represented as an instance of the <code>mlao:Anchor</code> class
  and connected with an instance of the oa:Annotation class by employing the
  mlao:hasAnchor property. The <code>mlao:Anchor</code> class describes the intentional
  object or referent of the annotation, which can be different from the target
  itself. The instance of the Anchor is then linked through the
  <code>mlao:hasConceptualLevel</code> object property to an instance of type <code>frbroo:F1_Work</code>,
  <code>frbroo:F2_Expression</code>, frbroo:F4_Manifestation or <code>frbroo:F5_Item</code>, describing
  the FRBR conceptual level. Finally, the Anchor is linked through the
  mlao:isAnchoredTo object property to an instance of the work it refers to
  which represents its real-world counterpart. By associating the annotation
  with a referent in the “real world” (an URI that describes an entity) and with
  an area in a piece of media that captured it, e.g. the target, we reduce the
  semantic deficit that separates the annotation from the thing being annotated
  and improve the computer's ability to use the link in a more general manner.
  For example, in the annotation modelled in Figure 2 the creator annotates a
  specific portion of the image to convey content, namely the transcription,
  which does not refer to the image itself but to another entity. In fact, the
  transcription does not concern the digital image itself but rather another
  kind of entity connected to the manuscript Vat. gr. 984 manuscript, which is
  an Expression according to the FRBR levels. Consequently, the annotation is
  linked to an anchor by the property mlao:hasAnchor. This allows the annotator
  to specify the conceptual level to which they are referring. Finally, the
  instance of mlao:Anchor class has two properties, mlao:hasConceptualLevel and
  mlao:isAnchoredTo, which are employed to specify the <code>frbroo:F2_Expression</code> and
  the real-world entity, respectively. The latter is represented by the URI that
  denotes the manuscript Vat. gr. 984, which is linked to the digital image.
