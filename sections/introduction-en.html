<span class="markdown">Multi-Level Annotation Ontology (MLAO) is a data model that leverages the Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) and integrates key domain standards to effectively address and mitigate the issue of semantic deficit in digital annotations.
    The primary objective of this ontology is therefore to extend the WADM through the integration of the Library Reference Model Ontology (LRMer) and the implementation of its integrated FRBRoo model. Moreover, some elements of the Historical Context Ontology (HiCO) are reused in order to represent the context of hermeneutical activities performed by scholars while generating new information (i.e. an interpretation act), enabling features such as criterion and type of cited sources. CIDOC-CRM and PROV-O standards are also considered to specify entity relationships and provenance. The following sections will present new classes and properties described in MLAO, as well as the existing ontologies which have been reused.
    
    The following figure shows classes (rectangles), object properties (solid lines
    beginning with a solid circle and ending with a solid arrow), and assertions
    among classes (solid lines ending with a solid arrow).
