<span class="markdown">The Historical Context Ontology (HiCO) is an OWL 2 DL ontology developed for representing the context of a claim. In particular, it addresses features characterising hermeneutical activities performed by scholars while generating new information (i.e. an interpretation act). It allows to represent and reason on reliability of argumentations around attributions, by evaluating features such as motivations, types of cited sources or criteria, dates, relations with other claims (e.g. agreement/disagreement). Specifically, historical context regards events and situations that are part of the life-cycle of cultural heritage objects. For instance, being created by somebody, or being created at a certain time, are events related to an artefact that are claimed by an agent at a certain time, motivated with usage of primary sources, and recorded in a secondary source (e.g. a cataloguing record). HiCO extends the PROV Ontology with terms for describing aspects of the hermeneutical activity, and reuses existing ontologies, such as CiTO Ontology for linking attributions to related sources.
